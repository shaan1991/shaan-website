# Advanced Jira Techniques: Boosting Efficiency for Experienced Users

Hello, Jira enthusiasts! If you’re already comfortable with Jira’s basics, it’s time to dive into some advanced techniques. These tips and tricks will help you boost your efficiency and make the most out of Jira’s powerful features.

## 1. **Advanced JQL Queries**

JQL (Jira Query Language) is a powerful tool for creating complex queries. Use advanced JQL functions like `WAS`, `CHANGED`, and `BEFORE` to build precise filters. For example, `status CHANGED TO "Done" AFTER -1w` shows issues that were completed in the last week.

## 2. **Automation with ScriptRunner**

ScriptRunner is an add-on that allows you to automate complex tasks with Groovy scripts. Use it to create custom workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and even extend Jira’s functionality. It’s a game-changer for experienced Jira users.

## 3. **Custom Gadgets for Dashboards**

Create custom gadgets to display specific metrics on your Jira dashboard. For example, you can build a gadget to show cycle time, lead time, or custom KPIs. This provides a quick and visual way to track your project’s performance.

## 4. **Portfolio for Jira**

If you’re managing multiple projects, Portfolio for Jira is a must-have. It helps you plan, track, and report across your entire portfolio of projects. Use it to visualize dependencies, forecast timelines, and align your projects with business goals.

## 5. **Service Desk Integration**

Integrate Jira Service Desk with your Jira Software instance to manage customer support and development in one place. This allows you to link support tickets with development tasks, providing seamless communication between support and engineering teams.

## 6. **Custom Issue Types**

Create custom issue types to match your team’s needs. For example, you might create issue types like “Bug,” “Feature Request,” or “Technical Debt.” Custom issue types help in categorizing and prioritizing work more effectively.

## 7. **Advanced Roadmaps**

Use Jira’s advanced roadmaps to plan and track work across multiple teams. Visualize progress, manage dependencies, and adjust plans as needed. Advanced roadmaps are ideal for keeping complex projects on track.

## 8. **Insight Asset Management**

If you need to manage assets within Jira, Insight is the tool for you. Track assets, dependencies, and relationships within Jira issues. This is particularly useful for IT teams managing hardware, software, and other resources.

## 9. **Custom Notifications**

Set up custom notifications to keep your team informed without overwhelming them. Tailor notifications based on issue types, statuses, or specific events. This ensures that everyone gets the right information at the right time.

## 10. **Performance Tuning**

If you’re working with a large Jira instance, performance can become an issue. Optimize your Jira instance by archiving old projects, regularly indexing, and monitoring performance metrics. A well-tuned Jira instance ensures smooth operation for all users.

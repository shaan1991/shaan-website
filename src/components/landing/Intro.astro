      Previously, I ran a startup that, while it didn't skyrocket, gave me a hefty dose of exposure and resilience. Nowadays, when I'm not steering a 40-strong team through the seas of deadlines and deliverables, you can find me indulging in my artistic pursuits â€“ from writing and singing to painting and cracking jokes. This eclectic mix of hobbies not only keeps my sanity intact but also sharpens my project management skills and user understanding.

      I've tackled numerous tech projects across multiple industries (shh, NDAs!), and my current mission? Mastering the art of pottery. My goal is to infuse every piece of work with creativity and joy, making the world a better place one project at a time.
